# Install SSH Key Authentication

Inspired by [keychain.io](https://github.com/progrium/keychain.io), just make SSH key configuration simpler.

## How to use it

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wbingli/publickeys/master/install.sh | bash
```

It may be too long to remember, go to [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com) to have a customized short url:

```
curl -sL http://tinyurl.com/wbingli-ssh-key | bash
```
